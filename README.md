# 游돒勇뀽hat is the ClockTemp
It is a clock that tells time according to the world clock by connecting via wifi and can measure temperature from 0-50 춿C and is displayed on an OLED screen.

# 游돒勇뀽hat is the Wemos D1 mini
WeMos D1 mini is a small microcontroller board based on the ESP8266 chip that can connect to Wi-Fi 2.4G, making it popular for developing various IoT (Internet of Things) projects.

**Key Features**
 - Measures temperature at a range of 0-50 춿C.
 - Can tell the time accurately because it is connected directly to the server via the internet.
 - Temperature and time are displayed on a 128*64 OLED screen.
 - Uses a Li-ion battery 3.7 V.
 - Uses 5 V charging power.
 - Use a type C charging cable.
